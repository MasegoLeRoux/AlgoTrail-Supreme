## Introduction

AlgoTrail-Supreme serves as a gallery where I showcase my problem-solving skills and proficiency in various programming languages. Each code example in this repository demonstrates my ability to craft elegant solutions to complex algorithmic problems, reflecting my dedication to continuous learning and mastery of these languages.

## Code Examples

Browse through the collection of code examples in the [CodeExamples](CodeExamples/) directory. Each directory contains implementations of different algorithms and data structures, accompanied by detailed explanations and comments.

## Textbooks

A selection of insightful textbooks has guided my journey in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. Here are some of the books that have played a pivotal role in shaping my understanding:

1. "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.
2. "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
3. "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python" by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser.
4. "JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms" by Sammie Bae.

These textbooks have provided me with a strong foundation, and I highly recommend them to anyone embarking on a journey to master algorithms and data structures.

## Currently Doing

I am actively sharpening my problem-solving skills in LeetCode and D.S. Malik - C++ Programming. Program Design including Data Structures-Cengag. You can find my solutions and approaches to a variety of algorithmic problems in the [LeetCode](LeetCode/) directory. Feel free to explore, learn, and provide feedback!
