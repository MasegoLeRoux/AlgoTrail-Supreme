
# Pattern Printing Application 📜

This is a simple command-line application that prints a decorative pattern along with some text. You can customize the text and pattern width according to your preferences.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- You need a C# compiler to build and run this application. Make sure you have one installed. If not, you can download the [C# compiler from Microsoft](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) or use an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio.

### Installation 🛠️

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using your preferred method (HTTPS or SSH).
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pattern-printing-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```shell
   cd pattern-printing-app
   ```

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.

4. Compile the program using the C# compiler:
   ```shell
   csc Program.cs
   ```

## Usage 📋

1. Run the compiled program:
   ```shell
   Program.exe
   ```

2. The program will display a decorative pattern with customizable text. You can customize the text and pattern width by modifying the code in the `Main` method in `Program.cs`:
   ```csharp
   string authorName = "Your Name"; // Replace with your name
   int width = 60; // Adjust the width as needed
   ```

3. Customize the program according to your preferences, save the changes, and recompile and run the program to see the updated pattern.

## Example 💡

Here's an example of a customized pattern:

```csharp
string authorName = "John Doe"; // Replace with your name
int width = 40; 
```
