# Programming Projects
# <p align="center">week_1</p>


This README file provides descriptions for several programming projects. Each project represents a coding challenge that you can work on to enhance your programming skills. 🚀

## Project 1: Sum of Decimal Numbers 🧮

### Description:
Write a C program that prompts the user to input five decimal numbers. The program should then add the five decimal numbers, convert the sum to the nearest integer, and print the result. 💡

## Project 2: Calculate Miles Without Refueling 🚗

### Description:
Create a C program that prompts the user for the capacity, in gallons, of an automobile's fuel tank and the miles per gallon (MPG) the automobile can be driven. The program should output the number of miles the automobile can be driven without refueling. 🛣️

## Project 3: Elapsed Time Conversion ⏱️

### Description:
Develop a C program that prompts the user to input the elapsed time for an event in seconds. The program should then output the elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, if the elapsed time is 9,630 seconds, then the output should be "2 hours, 40 minutes, and 30 seconds." ⏲️

## Project 4: Profit Calculation for a Store 💰

### Description:
Create a C program that reads the original price of an item sold, the percentage of the marked-up price, and the sales tax rate. The program should output the following:
- The original price of the item
- The percentage of the mark-up
- The store’s selling price of the item
- The sales tax rate
- The sales tax
- The final price of the item (selling price plus sales tax) 🏪

## Project 5: Hard Drive Storage Capacity Conversion 💽

### Description:
Write a C program that prompts the user to enter the size of a hard drive as specified by the manufacturer. Manufacturers often use 1,000 bytes as the value of 1KB, 1,000KB as the value of 1MB, and 1,000MB as the value of 1GB. The program should output the actual storage capacity of the hard drive, considering the computer memory standard where 1KB is equal to 1,024 bytes. 🖥️

## Project 6: Calculate Area of a Circle 🌕

### Description:
Implement and test the algorithm to calculate the area of a circle using the formula `Area = π * r^2`. Assume a constant value of π as 3.141593 in your program. 📏

## Project 7: Dairy Farm Profit Calculation 🐄

### Description:
Write a C program that calculates the profit of a dairy farm based on the following information:
- A milk carton can hold 3.78 liters of milk.
- The cost of producing one liter of milk is $0.38.
- The profit of each carton of milk is $0.27.
The program should prompt the user to enter the total amount of milk produced in the morning and output the following:
- The number of milk cartons needed to hold the milk.
- The cost of producing the milk.
- The profit for producing the milk. 🥛

## Project 8: Enhanced Dairy Farm Profit Calculation 📈

### Description:
Enhance the previous dairy farm profit calculation program by allowing the user to input the cost of producing one liter of milk and the profit on each carton of milk. 💰

## Project 9: Summer Job Income Calculation ☀️

### Description:
Write a C program that calculates your income from a summer job. The program should prompt the user to enter the pay rate per hour and the number of hours worked each week. It should also consider taxes, spending on clothes and school supplies, and savings bond purchases. The program should output various financial details. 💼

## Project 10: Coin Value Calculation 💰

### Description:
Create a C program that prompts the user to input the number of quarters, dimes, and nickels. The program should then output the total value of the coins in pennies. 💵

## Project 11: Salesperson's Commission 🚗

### Description:
Develop a C program that calculates the commission for a salesperson based on the selling price of a used car. The commission is paid as $20 plus 30% of the selling price in excess of the cost of the car. The program should allow the user to input various parameters and output the commission range. 📈

Feel free to choose any of these programming projects to work on and enhance your C programming skills. Each project comes with a specific description and task to complete. 🧑‍💻


## Code Examples

Browse through the collection of code examples in the [CodeExamples](CodeExamples/) directory. Each directory contains implementations of different algorithms and data structures, accompanied by detailed explanations and comments.

## Textbooks

A selection of insightful textbooks has guided my journey in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. Here are some of the books that have played a pivotal role in shaping my understanding:

1. "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.
2. "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
3. "Data Structures and Algorithms in Python" by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser.
4. "JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms" by Sammie Bae.

These textbooks have provided me with a strong foundation, and I highly recommend them to anyone embarking on a journey to master algorithms and data structures.

## Currently Doing

I am actively sharpening my problem-solving skills in LeetCode and D.S. Malik - C++ Programming. Program Design including Data Structures-Cengag. You can find my solutions and approaches to a variety of algorithmic problems in the [LeetCode](LeetCode/) directory. Feel free to explore, learn, and provide feedback!
